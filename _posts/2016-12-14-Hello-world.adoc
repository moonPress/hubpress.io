= Hello world

finally this blog online.

I will take to present the moonrise!

MoonRise is a name that has a lot of sense to me, has to do with the solitude that the moon bears and mostly overlap the difficulties that once prevented you from doing what you wanted.

Since I began to create my gamejams games, I realized that I worked best alone, but even so I arranged a group â€¦ even having great experiences and covering my knowledge none of them gave really sure.

I created the Kato Histories in 2013 with the idea of being a safe place that I would not let anyone touch that would not change, but I changed because of that had to move house.

Moonrise then appears as a new refuge not know how long will last.
